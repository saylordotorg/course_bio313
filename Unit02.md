**Unit 2: Population Fundamentals: Describing and Quantifying
Populations** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn mathematical models to describe basic,
single-species, density-independent population dynamics.  We will look
at how population growth is measured and then will examine the different
ways population growth can be predicted.  Birth rates, death rates, and
age structuring of a population will be discussed and integrated into
our predictive models.  We will also discuss how a population reaches
equilibrium and how population size might cycle across time, and we will
identify two important measures of population size: minimum viable
population and effective population size. *

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Use mathematical models to estimate population growth and calculate
    the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) and carrying capacity (K)
    for a population.
-   Construct and explain general, static, and cohort life history
    tables for a population.
-   Describe the factors that result in stable population size
    (equilibrium) and population cycling.
-   Describe the difference between minimum viable population (MVP) and
    effective population size (EPS) and explain the importance of these
    calculations in population conservation.

     Instructions: Please read this entire webpage, which describes
    factors that are considered in mathematical models that determine
    population growth.  All mathematical models provide only an estimate
    of population size.  Even if members of the population are trapped
    and counted, one can never be certain that all individuals have been
    trapped and countedbecause some organisms are trap-shy.  For every
    individual trapped and counted, scientists usually estimate that two
    additional individuals have not been counted.  Therefore,estimates
    of population size are usually underestimates.This material also
    covers subunits 2.3 through 2.3.2.
