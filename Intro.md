Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and between
organisms and their environments.  Population ecology is the subfield of
ecology that identifies those ecological factors—in the community or in
the ecosystem—that regulate a population’s size. Ecosystems and
communities involve complex interactions that have evolved over long
periods of time.  The species that are present and the interactions we
see between them are the result of evolution under the unique
environmental pressures that exist in a given environment.  These
interactions may be delicately intertwined, such that the loss of a
single species from a community could mean the collapse of the entire
community in a domino effect.  Thus, biologists are concerned with the
preservation of biodiversity in ecosystems—retaining as many different
species in the ecosystem as possible so the intricate relationships
among species are preserved. In recent years, we have seen a decrease in
the biodiversity of ecosystems.  Human activities are largely to blame
for this decline: Commercial fishing and harvesting of species for
souvenirs have dramatically reduced the populations of many aquatic
species; oil spills have damaged the environment and threatened the
survival of aquatic and terrestrial species; and human introduction of
nonnative species (“invasive species”) has led to the extinction of
native species.  The alteration of environments from their original
states to farmland, shopping centers, or housing developments has
resulted in the loss of habitats suitable for the species that
originally lived in those environments and accounts for much of this
loss of biodiversity. In this course, we will study interactions at the
population level.  In a broad sense, we are asking “How does a
single-species group of individuals living in a given habitat (i.e., a
population) manage to compete successfully with other species in order
to obtain essential resources and yet not become so numerous that the
population exceeds the habitat’s ability to support it?” We will learn
about intrinsic population growth (i.e., growth without limiting
factors) and discover how such growth can be quantified.  We will also
discuss the factors that prevent a population from realizing its
intrinsic growth potential and how those factors can be quantified. 
Finally, we will apply our understanding of population ecology to
determine a population’s current status and construct a management plan
to maintain that population at a desired size. This course should prove
particularly useful to those pursuing future study in epidemiology,
behavior, wildlife management, evolution, or computational biology.  It
will provide a basis from which to understand complex ecological
processes in a straightforward, quantifiable manner.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Explain how population ecology is used to address problems in
    evolution, conservation, epidemiology, and resource management. 
-   Describe the interactions among and between the biotic and abiotic
    components of a healthy ecosystem and explain how these components
    are interdependent.
-   Identify factors that threaten the maintenance of biodiversity in
    ecosystems and the population measures used to sustain ecosystem
    biodiversity. 
-   Use mathematical models and equations to describe population growth
    and interaction between populations. 
-   Identify density-dependent and density-independent factors that
    affect population growth and regulation. 
-   Employ the principles and techniques of population dynamics and
    ecology to analyze population viability and develop a resource
    management plan by using data gathered from a sample population.
