**Unit 3: Population Regulation: Intrinsic Factors and Environmental
Pressures That Affect Population Size** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will develop an understanding of natural population
regulation.  In reality, no habitat can support truly unchecked
population growth.  There will always be some limiting factor, whether
it be an intrinsic factor imposed by the population itself or an
extrinsic factor imposed by the environment (an “environmental
pressure”).  In this unit, we will begin to look at the issues that
complicate theoretical population dynamics.  We will discuss how
intrinsic density-dependent factors, such as food or disease, impose a
population ceiling beyond which population growth cannot be sustained. 
We will also learn how migration between populations within a
metapopulation can sustain smaller, more isolated populations.  Every
habitat contains more than one species, and we will see how interactions
between species populations will impact growth, carrying capacity, and
sustainability of each species.  We will also learn how to quantify the
impact of these interspecific interactions on a population’s growth.*

    population size. 
-   Define terms relevant to interspecific interactions and describe the
    possible outcomes of those interactions.
-   Use ecological models to predict the effect of interspecific
    interactions on population sizes.
-   Discuss factors that threaten the biodiversity of ecosystems.
-   Explain the intrinsic factors and the environmental pressures that
    allow invasive species to outcompete native species.
-   Describe the effects of human activities on habitats and how those
    activities affect population size.

    (HTML).  This lecture discusses density-dependent factors (i.e.,
    factors whose effect on the population increases with population
    size) and how they affect population growth.  This material also
    covers subunits 3.1.1 through 3.1.5.   
        
     *Note: The community interactions we learned about in Unit 1 come
    into play here.  If there were only one species, with unlimited
    resources, the population could grow infinitely.  Instead, a natural
    community will have some constraints.  As a population increases,
    competition will also increase.  Other organisms may also take
    advantage of the robust population to fill some of their own
    resource requirements (for nourishment!); disease, parasite load,
    and the predator population are also likely to increase.  In this
    section, we will discuss how each of these can affect mathematical
    population models.*
