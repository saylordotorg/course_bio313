**Unit 4: Population Management: Artificial Regulation of Population
Size** <span id="4"></span> 
*We will wrap up this course by learning how to apply our newfound
knowledge of population dynamics to real-world situations.  First, we
will review the importance of conservation at the population, species,
and ecosystem levels.  Next, we will discuss the sampling methods used
to gather the necessary data to develop population estimates and
models.  We will learn how to use this data to analyze the viability of
a population.  We will discuss methods of artificial population
regulation.  Finally, we will produce a resource management action
plan.*

    viability analysis (PVA) is conducted to assess the current size of
    a population, assess whether that size is large enough to ensure
    survival of the population, and design conservation programs to
    preserve the population by using the information obtained.
