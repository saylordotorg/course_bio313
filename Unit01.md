title: "BIO313: Population Ecology"
course_description: "An investigation of the interactions among organisms and their environment that influence and regulate population size. Covers forms of intrinsic population growth and factors affecting that growth, ecological relationships, and the means through which populations can be managed to maintain species and biodiversity."

**Unit 1: Population Ecology** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will review basic terms and concepts important to
understanding how a species or population fits into its environment.  We
will look at how an environment is organized,* *the typesof interactions
that occur in an environment, the different strategies that organisms
use to compete effectively within an environment, and why it is useful
to know this information.  Most of this material was touched on (at
least briefly) in [BIO102: Evolutionary and Ecological
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio102/).  As a result, this unit
should be something of a review.  However, we will spend more time on
various topics, such as life history evolution, that were not fully
covered in previous biology courses.  *

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Explain how population ecology addresses problems in evolution,
    conservation, epidemiology, and resource management.

    structure, population dynamics, and ecosystem functions.
-   Describe a population system and explain factors affecting processes
    within the population system.

    an ecosystem and explain how these components are interdependent.
-   Describe and explain examples of coevolution.
-   Describe the process of adaptation and how adaptations—advantageous
    and disadvantageous—affect population growth.

    succession in habitat modification.

     Instructions: This activity, based on the real research of a real
    scientist, allows you to observe the outcome of an evolutionary
    interaction between predators and their prey and how this
    interspecific interaction between species stabilizes the population
    sizes of predator and prey.  Please read about Professor John
    Endler’s research on brightly colored guppies in South America and
    the risk of predation taken by brightly colored male guppies in
    order to attract females for mating.  Then, run a simulation of
    predator-prey interaction: Set the initial number of bright male
    guppies and drab male guppies in the population and the predators
    present.  Run the simulation for 10 generations.  Explain the final
    ratio of bright male guppies to drab male guppies in terms of
    trade-offs between mating success and risk of predation.  This

    biology: Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection.
     This theory explains how populations survive by becoming adapted to
    the conditions in their environment.

    (HTML).  Life history strategies— the sequences of lifetime events
    that species evolve in order to cope with environmental
    pressures—directly affect the population birth and death rates for
    each species.  Understanding the life history strategy a population
    has evolved (or the varied strategies evolved by all the species
    within a community) is essential for understanding population growth
    and cycles.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please read this entire PDF.  Darwin’s theory of
    natural selection asserts that survival is only half the battle; to
    be successful, survivors must reproduce and pass their
    success-producing genes to the next generation.  Reproduction is
    essential for survival of the species; therefore, the reproductive
    strategy evolved by a population is a critical life history trait. 
    Evolution has produced multiple successful reproductive strategies,
    which are discussed in this reading.  This material also covers
    subunits 1.8.1.1 and 1.8.1.2.

    explain observed reproductive behaviors that seem to conflict with
    evolutionary “fitness” theory, such as why males compete for mates,
    why some species show parental care and others do not, why only some
    individuals in a group breed, and why some individuals in some
    species will forego breeding themselves and help others raise their
    young.

    (K-selected).  Pay special attention to the characteristics that
    distinguish r-selected species and K-selected species.
